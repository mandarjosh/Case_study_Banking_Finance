#  Lending Club Data 
Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers and investors. Since its inception in 2007, the platform has facilitated billions of dollars in loans and has become one of the largest online lending platforms in the world. The Lending Club Data Set is a comprehensive collection of data related to loans issued on the Lending Club platform.

The data set contains information on loans issued between 2007 and 2011, including loan amount, interest rate, loan term, credit score, and loan status (fully paid, charged off, etc.). It also includes information on the borrower, such as employment status, income, and debt-to-income ratio. The data set is updated regularly and provides a valuable resource for researchers and data analysts interested in the peer-to-peer lending industry.

# Understanding Data
This company is an online loan marketplace, offering personal, business and medical financing loans with low interest rates through a quick online platform. However, lending loans to high-risk applicants is the major cause of financial loss, referred to as credit loss. The aim of this study is to identify these high-risk applicants through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to reduce credit loss. The company's goal is to understand the key factors behind loan default and use this knowledge for portfolio and risk assessment. To enhance your understanding, you're encouraged to research the basics of risk analytics.

The Lending Club dataset contains information about loans issued by the Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform. The data includes variables such as the number of delinquencies on the borrower's account, their credit utilization, annual income, employment information, FICO scores, loan amount and status and payment history.

# Problem Description
- Lending Club data analysis involves exploring and analyzing data from the peer-to-peer lending platform, 
- Lending Club. The data can be used to understand trends and perform risk analysis. Analysts can use 
  various statistical and machine learning techniques to gain insights and make informed investment 
  decisions.
- A default occurs when no payment has been received for over 120 days. This requires ‘charge-off’. This is 
  a loss to the company. The goal is to identify the risk associated with each borrower so as to minimize 
  risk and hence loss. This is performed by understanding what causes lead to default. The answer is in the 
  data provided.

# Conclusions
* The study analyzed the pre-loan information of the dataset, ignoring the post-loan information as it is not relevant to the lender's decisionmaking process. The 
 overall risk was found to be 14%. The goal was to identify the major factors affecting the loan outcome.
* Loan Repayment: The majority of fully paid loans were more than 80%, while loans with more than 10% charge off were less frequent.
* Loan Grades: The largest volume of loans belonged to grades B, A, and C. However, grades F and G had the highest default rate of 32% and 
 29%, respectively.
* Home Ownership: Borrowers who rent showed the highest charge-off rate, while those who own their homes had the lowest. Borrowers still 
 paying for their homes through mortgage had higher charge-off rates and higher debt-to-income ratios.
* Loan Purpose: The highest probability of loan default was observed for debt consolidation and credit card payoff loans.
* Charge-off Rate: The majority of charge-off rates were between 0.11 and 0.16. Borrowers with lower interest rates tended to fully repay their 
 loans.
*  Employment Length: A charge-off rate of 15% was observed for borrowers with employment length over 10 years.
* Loan Amount: A strong relationship was observed between the loan amount requested and the approved loan amount. Borrowers who received 
 a lower amount than what they requested showed a spike in the charge-off rate
